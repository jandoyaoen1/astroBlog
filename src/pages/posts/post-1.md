# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-06-12

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my new journey as I build a new website

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and setup my online accounts

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages and by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages`

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown post!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
